Learning Path from GPT 4
=========================================================================

Always refer back to, and add to the syllabus from this as needed:
https://roadmap.sh/python

You can always double click or go deeper (ask for intermediate, advanced topics) on a certain bullet point topic, and ask for exercises on each level.




**Part 1: Python Fundamentals**

- **Topics:**
  - Python setup and installation
  - Variables, data types, and operators
  - Control flow: loops and conditional statements
  - Basic data structures: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
  - Functions and modules
  - File I/O operations

- **Project:**
  - Create a text-based adventure game where players make decisions through input prompts. For example, the game could involve exploring a castle, where each room presents a different situation and set of choices.

**Part 2: Intermediate Python**

- **Topics:**
  - Advanced data structures: stacks, queues, and trees
  - Object-oriented programming: classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism
  - Exception handling and debugging
  - Working with external libraries
  - Basic regular expressions for pattern matching

- **Project:**
  - Build a simple command-line address book application. Users should be able to add, edit, delete, and search for contacts, with the contact information stored in a file that persists between program runs.







**Part 3: Python for Data Science**

- **Topics:**
  - Introduction to NumPy and Pandas
  - Data cleaning and transformation
  - Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
  - Basic statistical analysis

- **Project:**
  - Analyze a dataset of your choice (e.g., from Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository). Clean the data, explore it with different visualizations, and present your findings in a clear, organized way.


After part 3 + project completed;
As I learn part 4, I will start developing my own telegram bots to do various things. Separate repository for this.
=> learning data science part also means that I can likely audit the gameplay data pretty well, I should do that as a hobby / pet project.




**Part 4: Advanced Python**

- **Topics:**
  - Multithreading and multiprocessing
  - Network programming (sockets, HTTP requests)
  - Database interaction with SQLite or PostgreSQL
  - Web scraping with Beautiful Soup and Selenium
  - Testing and test-driven development

- **Project:**
  - Develop a multi-threaded web scraper that retrieves and stores information from a website. Respect the site's terms of service and the legality of web scraping in your jurisdiction.




**Part 5: Python for Web Development**

- **Topics:**
  - Introduction to Flask or Django
  - Routing, templates, and forms
  - User authentication
  - Database integration with SQLAlchemy or Django's ORM
  - Deploying Python web applications

- **Project:**
  - Build and deploy a web application. This could be a personal blog, a portfolio, or a simple social network. Include user authentication and database-driven dynamic content.

Throughout each part of this learning path, always focus on writing clean, readable code and incorporating Python's "Zen" â€” principles like simplicity, clarity, and readability count. Enjoy your Python learning journey!
