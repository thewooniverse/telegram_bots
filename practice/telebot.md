MESSAGE DELETE
=========================================================================================================
To delete a message using the Telegram Bot API, you can use the `deleteMessage` method. Here's a basic overview of how to use this method:

1. **API Method**: The method you'd use is `deleteMessage`.
2. **Parameters**:
   - `chat_id`: Unique identifier for the target chat or username of the target channel.
   - `message_id`: Unique message identifier.

Here's a basic example using Python's `requests` library:

```python
import requests

TOKEN = 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN'
BASE_URL = f'https://api.telegram.org/bot{TOKEN}/'

def delete_message(chat_id, message_id):
    endpoint = f"{BASE_URL}deleteMessage"
    data = {
        "chat_id": chat_id,
        "message_id": message_id
    }
    response = requests.post(endpoint, data=data)
    return response.json()

# Usage
chat_id = "@yourchannel_or_chat_id"
message_id = 12345678  # ID of the message you want to delete
result = delete_message(chat_id, message_id)
print(result)
```

If you're using a library like `python-telegram-bot`, the process would be more streamlined. For instance:

```python
from telegram import Bot

TOKEN = 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN'
bot = Bot(token=TOKEN)

# To delete a message
bot.delete_message(chat_id="@yourchannel_or_chat_id", message_id=12345678)
```

Keep in mind the following restrictions when deleting messages:

- A bot can only delete its own messages or messages in supergroups and channels where it has the `Delete messages` permission.
- It is not possible to delete messages older than 48 hours in supergroups and channels.

## Message_id vs chat_id in state management
=========================================================================================================
When building a Telegram bot with menus and sub-menus, you have different options for maintaining state. The choice between using `chat_id` or `message_id` for state management largely depends on the nature of your bot's functionality and the kind of user interaction you're looking to achieve.

### Core Concepts:

1. **chat_id**: This is a unique identifier for a chatâ€”either with a single user or a group. The `chat_id` remains consistent over time.
2. **message_id**: This is a unique identifier for a message within a chat. Each new message in the same chat has a different `message_id`.
3. **State Management**: This involves tracking user interactions and data as users navigate through the bot's functionalities.

#### Using `chat_id` for State Management:

Storing the state by `chat_id` is beneficial if you're looking to maintain context across multiple interactions with the bot within a single chat. The state is preserved until it is explicitly changed or cleared.

##### Advantages:

1. Allows for seamless user experience.
2. Makes it easier to implement features like multi-step forms, quizzes, and workflows.
3. Facilitates tracking of user progress or settings over an extended period.

##### Example:

```python
# Dictionary to hold user states
user_states = {}

def handle_message(chat_id, message_text):
    if chat_id not in user_states:
        user_states[chat_id] = 'MAIN_MENU'
    
    current_state = user_states[chat_id]
    
    if current_state == 'MAIN_MENU':
        # Handle main menu logic
        pass
    elif current_state == 'SUB_MENU':
        # Handle sub menu logic
        pass
```

#### Using `message_id` for State Management:

Storing the state by `message_id` is useful for transient states tied to specific messages, like inline keyboards with callback queries.

##### Advantages:

1. Useful for stateless, ephemeral interactions like quick polls or one-time decisions.
2. Makes it easier to manage individual message states without affecting the whole chat context.

##### Example:

```python
# Dictionary to hold message states
message_states = {}

def handle_callback_query(chat_id, message_id, callback_data):
    state_key = f"{chat_id}_{message_id}"
    
    if state_key not in message_states:
        message_states[state_key] = 'INITIAL_STATE'
    current_state = message_states[state_key]
    
    if current_state == 'INITIAL_STATE':
        # Handle initial state logic
        pass
```

### Best Practices:

1. **Database Storage**: For more permanent state storage and to handle multiple users effectively, consider using databases like SQLite, MySQL, or NoSQL solutions.
2. **Error Handling**: Add adequate error and exception handling, especially when reading and writing to a state storage mechanism.
3. **Concurrency**: If your bot will handle multiple users simultaneously, ensure your state management is thread-safe.
4. **State Expiry**: Implement a timeout feature to clear or reset the state after a period of inactivity, if applicable.
5. **Logging**: Maintain logs to track state changes, which can help in debugging issues related to state management.

In summary, if your bot's functionality requires maintaining a more extended conversation with users, `chat_id` is likely more suitable. If you need to handle short-lived, message-specific interactions, then `message_id` could be more appropriate. Often, a combination of both may offer the most robust solution.

## process management
=========================================================================================================
Manually terminating all instances of a running bot and then restarting only one instance depends on how you initially started the bot and the operating system you are using. Here's a general guide for both Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) and Windows.

### Core Concepts:

1. **Process**: A running instance of a program. In this case, each instance of your bot is a separate process.

2. **Process ID (PID)**: A unique identifier for each running process.

3. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: A textual interface to interact with your computer.

### For Unix-like Systems:

1. **Find the Process ID**: Open a terminal and run the following command to find the Process IDs (PIDs) for all running instances of your bot:

    ```bash
    ps aux | grep 'name_of_your_bot_script'
    ```

    This will list all processes that include the name of your bot script. Note the PID(s) listed at the beginning of each line.

2. **Terminate the Process**: To terminate a process, run the `kill` command followed by the PID:

    ```bash
    kill -9 PID
    ```

    Replace `PID` with the Process ID you noted earlier. If there are multiple, you can terminate them one by one.

3. **Restart the Bot**: Once you have terminated all instances, you can restart your bot by running it again:

    ```bash
    python name_of_your_bot_script.py
    ```

### For Windows Systems:

1. **Open Task Manager**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+Esc` to open the Task Manager.

2. **Find the Process**: In the "Processes" tab, look for your script name or `python.exe` or `python3.exe` instances that might be running your bot.

3. **End the Process**: Select the process and click on the "End Task" button to stop it.

4. **Restart the Bot**: Navigate to your bot's script location in the Command Prompt and run:

    ```cmd
    python name_of_your_bot_script.py
    ```

### Best Practices:

1. **Use Meaningful Script Names**: Naming your bot script uniquely can help easily identify it among other running processes.

2. **Script Logging**: Incorporate logging in your script to capture events and errors. This helps in debugging and auditing.

3. **Graceful Shutdown**: If your bot maintains state or needs to perform some cleanup actions, consider catching termination signals for a graceful shutdown. In Python, you can use the `signal` module for this.

By following these steps and best practices, you can effectively manage manual termination and restart of your bot instances.


## PART 2 - targeting / killing
In the output you've posted, each line represents a process, and the PID (Process ID) is the second field in each line. Here are the lines simplified for clarity:

1. `woo 44158 ... grep --color=auto ... practice.py`: This line actually represents the `grep` command itself, which is looking for the string "practice.py". The PID here is `44158`, but this is not the process you're interested in terminating.

2. `woo 42917 ... Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python practice.py`: This line represents the actual running instance of your Python script, `practice.py`. The PID is `42917`, and this is the process you would terminate if you want to stop this instance of your bot.

So, the PID for your running Python script is `42917`.

### Core Concepts:

1. **PID (Process ID)**: Each running process has a unique identifier called a PID.

2. **Terminal Fields**: When you run `ps aux | grep ...`, the output is a list of fields. The second field represents the PID.

### Termination:

To terminate this process, you would run:

```bash
kill -9 42917
```

### Best Practices:

1. **Verify Before Killing**: Always double-check to make sure you are terminating the correct process, as `kill -9` is a forceful termination command that will immediately kill the process.

2. **Less Aggressive Termination**: You could first try a less aggressive termination signal, like `kill 42917` (without the `-9`), which allows the process to perform cleanup operations before exiting. If that doesn't work, then you can use `kill -9`.

By understanding the terminal output and PID, you can effectively manage your running processes.
