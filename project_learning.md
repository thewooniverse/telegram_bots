## Memory IO and file IO - performance and speed
When dealing with the question of performance between saving a Matplotlib figure to bytes and then sending it over a network, versus saving it to a file and then reading and sending that file, several factors come into play. These include I/O performance, network latency, and CPU utilization.

### Core Concepts:

- **I/O Performance**: Disk operations (read/write) can be a bottleneck depending on the storage medium.
- **Network Latency**: The time taken to send data over a network.
- **CPU Utilization**: The amount of processing power used.

### Saving Figure to Bytes:

When you save the figure to a `BytesIO` object, the data stays in memory.

#### Advantages:

1. **Faster I/O**: Memory operations are generally faster than disk operations.
2. **Reduced Latency**: No need to read from disk after saving; the data is readily available in memory for network transfer.
3. **Filesystem Overhead**: Avoids filesystem permissions, locks, and other potential overheads.

#### Disadvantages:

1. **Memory Usage**: If the plot is very large, you may consume significant memory, which can be an issue in constrained environments.

### Saving Figure to File:

In this approach, you save the plot to a file and then read it back to send it over the network.

#### Advantages:

1. **Less Memory Consumption**: Once the image is written to disk, it doesn't occupy application memory.
2. **Persistence**: The image is saved on disk, which can be useful if you need to send it multiple times or keep it for records.

#### Disadvantages:

1. **Slower I/O**: Disk operations are generally slower than memory operations.
2. **Increased Latency**: Need to perform additional disk read operation after writing the file.

### Best Practices for Performance:

1. **Concurrency**: If you have to perform multiple operations (like generating different plots), consider using concurrency models to parallelize network sending and image generation.
  
2. **Compression**: If network latency is a concern, consider using a format like PNG or JPEG with high compression ratios before sending the data.

3. **Buffer Management**: If you opt for the `BytesIO` approach, ensure that you free the memory by closing the buffer once the data is sent.

### Conclusion:

In general, saving to a `BytesIO` object and directly sending that over the network is usually faster because it eliminates the need for slower disk I/O operations. However, the best approach will depend on your specific constraints such as memory availability, the need for image persistence, and the performance characteristics of your storage medium and network.
